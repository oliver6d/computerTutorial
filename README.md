Website tutorial for how to use computers
Developing a guided interface to mitigate computer illiteracy


ABSTRACT
As technology becomes more prevalant in the world, it is easy to forget that there still exist people who have never used a computer before.  

MOTIVATION
 - PEOPLE
 The target audience for this program will be people who have NEVER used a computer before.  
 While elderly people are also a good target audience for teaching basic computer skills, we will focus on people in developing countries, who don't have someone else to help them learn the most basic of skills
 We will make the assumption that they have a very limited familiarity with english, and will require a majority of the explanation to be done through pictures
 An option could be to translate the text into many languages, but general literacy may be limited.  We also would like to avoid limiting the populatioin who can learn from this.  The target audience is incredibly diverse, knowing MANY different languages and dialects, including tribal languages and others that currently have no translators
 - EXISTING RESOURCES
 While many resources (videos, books, websites, help forums) exist to help people improve their computer skills, there exist very few resources for the people who have never touched a computer
 Sometimes, when computers are introduced to a group in a developing country, some basic training is given.  However, since there are SO many people who need to learn and so much to teach, it can be difficult to teach everyone. The finer skills that people really struggle with (double clicking, holding down shift, etc) require one-on-one interaction.  However, even after an hour of detailed instruction, many people end up forgetting the skills they learned or missing out on one with the possibility that the instructor skipped over it.


 METHOD
  - WEBSITE
  I will be using web development to create a simulation environment of an operating system.  Websites can be ran on both linux and windows computers without requiring separate programs to be created.  It can also be made accessible to anyone with an internet connection.
  Most usefully, the website can be hosted locally for those without an internet connection by downloading everything onto a computer.  This is very important, as many people in these situations will not have internet, or will not have a good connection
  There can be a shortcut icon on the desktop to open the application, and it can be programmed to automatically go to full screen.  If a local copy is made, it is important not to use any development resources that require internet (APIs,  )
  - SECTIONS
  - TESTING
  Data can be collected from the website
